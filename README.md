# sieve-of-eratosthenes-python
Comparing code efficiency in different programming languages by implementing a simple Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm

Additionaly, this repository also serves as my attempt to write efficient code in the languages I know, whenever I learn something new that might improve efficieny, it gets added.
